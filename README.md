## Problem Statement

Champion customers (e.g., high-income bachelors, affluent parents, high-income retirees) are not engaging effectively in referral programs. Social barriers, low visibility of savings accounts in social discourse, and limited interaction with Relationship Managers (RMs) contribute to this issue. There’s a need to revamp IDFC's referral system to make it attractive, digital-first, and behaviorally rewarding.
